#The REDS concept

_**Note:** There will only be a german version of the concept as long as the status is still experimantal. Later versions will be translated to english._

The documents in this repository describe REDS ("Remotely Encrypted Distributed Storage"). REDS is a distributed data storage concept for cloud services, whichs allows the anonymous and encrypted usage of a service, but preserves the ability of the service owner control access to the service. This way users keep control of their data, while the owners are able to add value-added models, such as fremium, to their service.

The concept describes REDS in an abstact way. This means that it describes the protocols and structures used in REDS, but not how to implement them in real code. Currently the following implementations of REDS are known:

  * [REDS.web](http://github.com/flowyapps/reds-web): a web application framework

The REDS concept is developed and maintained by Flowy Apps. More information about REDS and Flowy Apps be found on the following websites:

  * The official REDS website: http://reds.io
  * The website of Flowy Apps: http://flowyapps.com 

##Status

REDS should be see as **experimental** at the moment. This means that even though there is already a working implementation, most parts of the concept are likely to change during the further development process. Therefore it is not recomended to publish works that rely on the REDS concept right now.
